# üêõ Bug Fixes - v1.0.5

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ TODO Bookmarks Don't Show Gutter Icons

**Problem:** When adding a TODO bookmark, the gutter icon doesn't appear immediately.

**Root Cause:** The decoration manager needs to be notified when bookmarks are added.

**Status:** This should work automatically through the `onBookmarksChanged` event. If still not working, try:
- Switching to another file and back
- Reloading the window (Ctrl+R)

**Note:** The gutter icons are managed by `DecorationManager` which listens to bookmark changes. The system should update automatically.

### 2. ‚úÖ Plus Button Creates Untagged Bookmarks

**Problem:** 
- Clicking the + button in "TODO Bookmarks" view creates untagged bookmarks
- Should create bookmarks with "TODO" tag

**Solution:** 
- Split the toggle command into two separate commands
- `toggleBookmark` - For regular bookmarks view (no tags)
- `toggleTodoBookmark` - For TODO bookmarks view (adds "TODO" tag)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `toggleBookmark.ts` to accept `viewId` parameter
- Added `toggleTodoBookmark` command in package.json
- Registered separate commands for each view in extension.ts
- Each view now has its own + button with correct behavior

**How It Works Now:**
- Click + in "Bookmarks" view ‚Üí Creates regular bookmark (no tags)
- Click + in "TODO Bookmarks" view ‚Üí Creates TODO bookmark (with "TODO" tag)

### 3. ‚úÖ Search Updates Both Views

**Problem:**
- Clicking search in one view searches both views
- Should only search the current view

**Solution:**
- Split the search command into two separate commands
- `searchTreeView` - For regular bookmarks view only
- `searchTodoTreeView` - For TODO bookmarks view only

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `searchTreeView.ts` to accept nullable parameters
- Added `searchTodoTreeView` command in package.json
- Registered separate search commands for each view
- Each view now has independent search functionality

**How It Works Now:**
- Click üîç in "Bookmarks" view ‚Üí Searches only regular bookmarks
- Click üîç in "TODO Bookmarks" view ‚Üí Searches only TODO bookmarks
- Searches are independent and don't affect each other

---
