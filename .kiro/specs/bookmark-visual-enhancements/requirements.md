Perubahan ini akan membuat extension lebih menarik secara visual dan meningkatkan user experience dalam mengelola bookmark.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Extension Icon

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension icon to have a more modern and appealing design with better colors and style, so that the extension looks more professional and attractive in the marketplace and sidebar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN the icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain good contrast and visibility at different sizes (16px, 32px, 64px, 128px)
5. WHEN the icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL use colors that are distinct and memorable (e.g., blue/purple gradient)
6. WHEN the icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the bookmark theme while being more stylish

### Requirement 2: Numbered Bookmark Items in Tree View

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see sequential numbers on each bookmark item in the tree view, so that I can easily reference specific bookmarks and understand the order of my bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN bookmarks are grouped by tags THEN the system SHALL number bookmarks sequentially within each tag group starting from 1

5. WHEN bookmarks are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent number formatting with leading zeros for alignment if there are more than 9 bookmarks (e.g., "01", "02", ... "10")
6. WHEN the tree view is refreshed THEN the system SHALL preserve the numbering order based on bookmark creation time or current order

### Requirement 3: Numbered Icons for Bookmark Items

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the bookmark number displayed on the icon itself in the tree view, so that I can quickly identify bookmarks visually without reading the full title.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bookmark is displayed in the tree view THEN the system SHALL show a custom icon with the bookmark number overlaid on it
2. WHEN the bookmark number is 1-9 THEN the system SHALL display a single digit on the icon

5. WHEN the icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the bookmark theme while incorporating the number
6. WHEN bookmarks are renumbered THEN the system SHALL update the icon to reflect the new number
7. IF there are more than 99 bookmarks in a group THEN the system SHALL display "99+" on the icon or use a different visual indicator

### Requirement 4: Visual Consistency

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent color palette across the extension icon and bookmark icons
2. WHEN icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling (shadows, borders, gradients) across all icon types
3. WHEN the extension is used in different VS Code themes (light/dark) THEN the system SHALL ensure icons remain visible and attractive
4. WHEN numbers are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent font style and size across all numbered elements
5. WHEN the tree view is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment for numbered items

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the visual enhancements to work seamlessly with my existing bookmarks, so that I don't lose any functionality or data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced version is installed THEN the system SHALL load all existing bookmarks without modification to the data structure
2. WHEN bookmarks are displayed THEN the system SHALL apply numbering without modifying the stored bookmark data
3. WHEN the extension is updated THEN the system SHALL not require any migration or user action
4. WHEN bookmarks are created or modified THEN the system SHALL continue to use the existing storage format
5. WHEN the tree view is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality (navigation, editing, deletion)
